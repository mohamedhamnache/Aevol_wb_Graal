As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you\nto follow:\n\nStack\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\n\nStack\nCompodoc is written in TypeScript. The compiling process use Rollup.js\nDevelopment process\n\nopen one terminal and run inside compodoc folder : ǹpm run start\nopen another terminal with the source code of the demo project, and run compodoc -p src/tsconfig.json -a screenshots -n 'TodoMVC Angular documentation' --includes additional-doc --toggleMenuItems 'all'\" -s\n\nDebugging process\n\nopen one terminal and run inside compodoc folder : ǹpm run start\nopen another terminal with the source code of the demo project, and run node --inspect ../compodoc/bin/index-cli.js -p src/tsconfig.json -a screenshots -n 'TodoMVC Angular documentation' --includes additional-doc --toggleMenuItems 'all'\" -s\n\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can  submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.\nFirst open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\n Submission Guidelines\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\nWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario. Having a reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:\n\nversion of compodoc, Node.js used\n.tsconfig.json configuration\nand most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\nA minimal reproduce scenario using allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.\nWe will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.\nUnfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.\nYou can file new issues by filling out our new issue form.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR   that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\nRun the full Compodoc test suite, and ensure that all tests pass (coming soon).\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to compodoc:develop.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run the Compodoc test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:\n  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests or e2e-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBC).\nWe follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide, but wrap all code at\n100 characters.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the Angular CLI change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nRevert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n\nScope\nThe scope should be the name of the npm package affected as perceived by the person reading changelog generated from the commit messages.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not There are currently a few exceptions to the \"use package name\" rule:\n\npackaging: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages, e.g. public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, d.ts file/format changes, changes to bundles, etc.\nchangelog: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md\nnone/empty string: useful for style, test and refactor changes that are done across all packages (e.g. style: add missing semicolons)\n\nThere are currently a few exceptions to the \"use package name\" rule:\n\npackaging: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages, e.g. public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, d.ts file/format changes, changes to bundles, etc.\nchangelog: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md\nnone/empty string: useful for style, test and refactor changes that are done across all packages (e.g. style: add missing semicolons)\n\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.
